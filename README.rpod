=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDL::CCS is a set of perl modules for representation and manipulation
of large sparse n-dimensional numeric arrays using PDL.  It includes
a perl class implementing a subset of the PDL API for memory-efficient
storage and operations on large sparse arrays, as well as utilities
for extracting Harwell-Boeing compressed column- and/or row-storage
"pointers" from/to indexND() vector lists.

=head1 BUILDING

Build this module as you would any perl module, by doing something
akin to the following:

 gzip -dc distname-XX.YY.tar.gz | tar -xof -
 cd distname-XX.YY/
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test                                     # optional
 make install

See L<perlmodinstall>(1) for details.
